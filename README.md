## Water Quality Index (WQI) Calculation

To calculate the **Water Quality Index (WQI)**, we used the [**tikatuwq**](https://github.com/tikatuwq/tikatuwq) package, developed in the **R programming language** and available on GitHub.  
This package streamlined the workflow by automating the complex calculations required for computing the WQI, which would otherwise be time-consuming and difficult to perform manually.
